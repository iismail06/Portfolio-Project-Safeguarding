## Deployment

The website is designed to be deployed on any static hosting platform:

### GitHub Pages

1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Select main branch as source
4. Access via: `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

## 🚪 Quick Exit Button

This website includes a **Quick Exit** button to enhance user safety and privacy. Since the site contains information related to safeguarding, users may need to leave the page quickly in sensitive or potentially unsafe situations.

The button is:

- Clearly visible at the top-right of every page.
- Fixed in place so it’s always accessible while scrolling.
- Designed to **immediately redirect the user** to a neutral website (like BBC Weather), while also opening it in a new tab.

This feature helps users **minimize risk** if someone nearby might see what they’re viewing and become suspicious or controlling.

## 🔮 Future Work

While the current version of the website meets its core aims, there are several features and enhancements planned for future development:

- Add an **About Us** page to introduce the purpose of the site, its creators, and its mission.
- Integrate a contact form with real-time validation and secure backend handling.
- Improve the visual design for mobile-first experiences.
- Include a resource hub for downloadable safeguarding materials.
- Add multilingual support to reach a broader audience.

These updates will help create a more informative, supportive, and accessible experience for users.
